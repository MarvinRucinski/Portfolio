summary:"",
longDescription: `As part of the project, a comprehensive system was created to monitor soil moisture in a plant pot. To enable accurate and continuous measurements, a microcontroller was used to read data from the moisture sensor installed in the pot. This allows users to track the moisture level in their plants in real-time and receive appropriate notifications through Facebook Messenger Bot in case of low moisture.

An important feature of the system is the ability to store the history of moisture levels, enabling users to analyze long-term trends and adjust watering accordingly. This data can also be used for research purposes, such as studying the impact of weather conditions on soil moisture.

The Facebook Messenger Bot, used to send notifications about the plant's watering needs, was implemented to provide users with a convenient and easy way to stay informed about the status of their plants. With this bot, users can be assured that they will always be up to date with their plant's needs.

In this way, the system for monitoring soil moisture in a plant pot, using a microcontroller, sensor, and notifications through Facebook Messenger Bot, becomes a complete and functional solution, enabling users to conveniently and effectively care for their plants.`,

This project demonstrates my ability to work with hardware and software, as well as my creativity in finding new and innovative ways to use technology. The use of the 3D printer allowed me to create custom-designed lamps that are not only functional, but also visually appealing. The incorporation of the ESP8266 microcontroller and the modification of the WLED software required a strong understanding of both hardware and software, and I am proud of the end result.

Overall, this project is a great example of my skills and capabilities as a maker and inventor, and I am excited to share it with you in my portfolio.`,
