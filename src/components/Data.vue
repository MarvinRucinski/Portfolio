This tool was created for people who share a space with others and want to maintain order without unnecessary stress. The app is especially useful for students renting apartments by the room, where it's easy to get confused about household chores.

With the Duties App, cleaning together is much simpler:

‚úÖ Create and assign duties for individual rooms or the entire apartment
‚úÖ Automatic notifications about upcoming duties
‚úÖ Ready-made task lists and easy assignment of responsibilities to roommates
‚úÖ Clear history of completed tasks ‚Äì all in one place

Working on the app was a big challenge, but I'm proud of the results and hope that the Duties App will prove to be a practical solution for many users. I'm looking forward to feedback and ideas from everyone who would like to test it!`,

Key Features:
- <b>Vision System</b>: The dispenser uses a wide-angle camera and a trained neural network to detect red cups placed within the dispensing area. The system captures an image, crops it, and analyzes it to identify the cup positions with 99% accuracy.
- <b>Control System</b>: The control system, based on stepper motors, Arduino, and Klipper3D software, calculates the coordinates of the cups and moves the dispenser to the nearest cup to pour the beverage for a specified duration.
- <b>Efficiency</b>: After pouring, the dispenser performs quick movements to shake off any remaining drops from the nozzle before moving to the next cup or returning to the start position.

Achievements:
- 2nd place for the best booth promoting student activity during DAS 2024.
- Finalist in the 10th edition of the Student Construction Competition (KoKos) in the Smart Robots category.

This project exemplifies the combination of creativity, teamwork, and technological innovation, demonstrating the potential of student-led initiatives.`,

And if you need a little extra motivation, we even have a feature that uses the OpenAI API to generate humorous images and messages to encourage you and your roommates to get cleaning.

But it's not just about getting the work done ‚Äì we also want to make it easy for you to see how everyone is contributing to the cleaning efforts. That's why we have a dedicated page for displaying statistics and charts about who has completed the most tasks and how much progress has been made overall. This allows roommates to see who is pulling their weight and where there may be room for improvement.

With our app, staying organized and keeping your apartment clean has never been easier. It's the perfect tool for anyone looking to live in a harmonious and well-maintained shared living space.`,
